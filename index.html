    <dt>What exactly is a quiet place?</dt>
    <dd>A quiet place is where one goes to get away from the <em>chaos</em> and often <em>stifling</em> feeling one gets from this world. A quiet place is a place of solitude, an <em>impregnable</em> fortress </em> that brings peace</dd>

</dl>
    <br>
    <p>Here are a couple of pictures depicting what my quiet place looks like.<br>Each has it's own special meaning, and they are: <br>
        <p align="left">
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Love</li>
                <li>Joy</li>
                <li>Peace</li>
                <li>Patience</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    <em>Before that though, below is a table that shows for me, the correlation between the emotions my quiet place brings forth and a flower. Flowers, actually</em>
    <div align="center">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
            <tr>
            <th>Emotions </th>
            <th>Flower </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Love</td>
                <td>Rose</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Joy</td>
                <td>Sunflower</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Peace</td>
                <td>Baby's-Breath</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Patience</td>
                <td>Marigolds</td>
            </tr>
